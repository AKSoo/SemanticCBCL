# SemanticCBCL
An ABCD-ReproNim project to prototype methods and procedures for handling (restricted) ABCD data using NIDM to create a ReproPond that can be integrated with similar data from other sources. We will use the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) as a test case, but the results should be generalizable to any NDA-hosted data schema.
